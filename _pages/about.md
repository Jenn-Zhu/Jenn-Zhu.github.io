I'm the Principal Scientist of [Origin Research](https://www.originwirelessai.com/) in Rockville, MD, USA, working on wireless sensing with [K. J. Ray Liu](https://kjrayliu.org/). 

Before joining, I earned an M.S. degree and a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the [ECE Department](https://ece.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://www.umd.edu/), MD, USA in 2022 and 2023, respectively. I received a B.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China in 2019. 

My research interests include wireless sensing, artificial intelligence, signal and image processing, the Internet of Things, and simultaneous indoor localization and mapping. **I like cool and artistic research works but believe in those solving real-world problems.**

**Discussions and collaborations are always welcomed!**
